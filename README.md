# Bulk Renamer

This program will search through all sub-folders in a given directory and to
rename any files or folders that have invalid characters.

## Purpose

I designed this program to assist users with fixing invalid filenames when
backing up large directories to Microsoft OneDrive. By recursively searching
through each file and folder, the program can check that there are no invalid
characters or filenames that would cause an upload error.
